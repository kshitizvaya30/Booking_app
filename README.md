# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Join me in this video as we dive into the inner workings of our latest project, a web application built using React JS and Node. I will be explaining the technical concepts and the architecture of the project. We'll also demonstrate some of the key features of the application and how they are implemented. By the end of the video, you will have a good understanding of how this project functions and the technology behind it. "

The current system lacks a login feature, allowing users to view their ticket history by simply entering their email address. However, with the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), an access token will be sent to the backend for verification. Upon successful validation, the email within the token's subject will be used to retrieve the corresponding ticket details.

The user interface (UI) can be further enhanced by improving the layout of cards, adapting the seat design for various devices, and incorporating additional features.
A PDF functionality has been added to the system, however, the design of the generated ticket can be improved by incorporating images and other visual elements.

### Deployment Issues
There could be various reasons for issues while loading a website, including issues with the free version of the render app for backend deployment. It is possible that the free version may not be providing data properly. If you are experiencing issues, it is best to contact me about the issue.
